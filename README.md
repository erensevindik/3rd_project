<h1>This project Uses Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses and filter for a dataset to analyze.</h1>


<h2>How to run script</h2>
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder,atom or Pycharm.This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer.

<h2>Datasets</h2>
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

<ul>
<li>Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)</li>
<li>End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)</li>
<li>Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)</li>
<li>Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)</li>
<li>End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)</li>
<li>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Birth Year</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statistics Computed</h2>
In this project, the code is written to provide the following information:

<p>Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)</p>

<ul>
<li>most common month</li>
<li>most common day of week</li>
<li>most common hour of day</li>
</ul>

<p>Popular stations and trip</p>
<ul>
<li>most common start station</li>
<li>most common end station</li>
<li>most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)</li>
</ul>

<p>Trip duration</p>
<ul>
<li>total travel time</li>
<li>average travel time</li>
</ul>

<p>User info</p>
<ul>
<li>counts of each user type</li>
<li>counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)</li>
<li>earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)</li>
</ul>
